import { Anchor } from "../components/Anchor";

Downloading an image programmatically is fairly straightforward and can be broken down into 3 steps:

- Fetch the url of an image and get the [blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) of the response.
- Turn the blob into a url.
- Create an anchor element and set its `href` to the url received from the blob and add the `download` attribute to the element.

First, we'll create an asynchronous function that fetches the image and returns the response as a blob.

```js
async function fetchImage(imgURL) {
  const res = await fetch(imgURL);
  return res.blob();
}
```

Once that's done, we need to create a URL out of the blob so that we can use it later to download the image. We can accomplish this by using `URL.createObjectURL()` which will create a string representing the data of the image.
Fetching the image is important because downloads requires the url to be under the <Anchor href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy' target="_blank">**same-origin**</Anchor>.

```js
async function downloadImage() {
  const blob = await fetchImage("random-url");
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
}
```

Finally, we'll create an anchor element and dispatch a click event so that we can download the image to our computer.

```js
async function downloadImage() {
  const blob = await fetchImage("random-url");
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

  const anchor = document.createElement("a");
  anchor.href = url;
  //You can specify what the name of the file will be
  //by setting the download property to a custom string
  anchor.download = "my-image";
  anchor.click();

  //Calling this method important to avoid memory leaks
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}
```

And that's it! You've successfully learned how to download images programmatically!
Here's what the full code might look like when using plain JavaScript.

```js
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

const image = "random-url";

async function fetchImage(imgURL) {
  const res = await fetch(imgURL);
  return res.blob();
}

async function downloadImage() {
  const blob = await fetchImage(image);
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

  const anchor = document.createElement("a");
  anchor.href = url;
  //You can specify what the name of the file will be
  //by setting the download property to a custom string
  anchor.download = "my-image";
  anchor.click();

  //Calling this method important to avoid memory leaks
  URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}

btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  downloadImage();
});
```
