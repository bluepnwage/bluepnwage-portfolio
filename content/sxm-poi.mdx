This was my first major project after learning [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). I made use of the mapbox API in order to display an interactive map, a postgres database hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) to store geoJSON data of differents points of interests, and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) to help interact with the database.
