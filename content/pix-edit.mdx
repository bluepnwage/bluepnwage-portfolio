PixEdit is a simple project that enables you to resize and reformat images. It is built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and image transformations are powered by [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). You can select which formats you would like to download an image in and create presets for different sizes. You can also save your settings for future visits to the web page. When an image is ready to be downloaded, streaming data and processing it in chunks allows you to monitor the download progress.
