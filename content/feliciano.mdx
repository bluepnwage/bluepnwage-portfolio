This project was built so that I could practice optimizing performance when dealing with large images, setting up scroll animations with [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion) motion, and provide users the option to reserve a table online, then storing the information in a MongoDB database. I also practiced using scheduled functions to automatically remove all passed reservations in the database.
