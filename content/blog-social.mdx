This project was created so I can practice using a Backend-as-a-Service with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for the first time, and make use of the newest features for Next.js such as [On-demand incremental static regeneration](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=next-website#on-demand-incremental-static-regeneration-stable), which allows me to update certain pages on a website without needing to redeploy. In this website, users are allowed to sign up, write and publish blogs, update their profile, and view other users' profiles.
